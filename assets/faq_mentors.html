      <p><b><span style="font-size: 12pt">FAQ&#8217;s for Personal and Peer
      Mentors</span></b></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; background: white"><span style=
      "font-size: 11pt">1.&nbsp;When will I get information about my mentee?</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-size: 11pt">A
      mentor will be provided with information of his or her new mentee before the start
      of classes.<br />
      <br />
      2.&nbsp;How will my mentee know that I am his/her mentor?</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; background: white"><span style="font-size: 11pt">A
      mentee will receive a letter from the CARE Program with instructions on how to
      contact his or her mentor.<br />
      <br />
      3.&nbsp;As Peer Mentor, how should I prepare myself in my first meeting with my
      mentee?</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; background: white"><span style=
      "font-size: 11pt">Review the Peer Mentor Manual (p. 8-12) and the Mentee
      Improvement Plan (p. 34).<br />
      <br />
      4.&nbsp;Should I ask my mentee of his or her Mentee Improvement Plan (MIP) during
      the first meeting?</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; background: white"><span style=
      "font-size: 11pt">Yes, and review all information entered by your mentee in the
      MIP.<br />
      <br />
      5.&nbsp;What should I do if my mentee has not yet completed his or her Mentee
      Improvement Plan by the first meeting?</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; background: white"><span style=
      "font-size: 11pt">Ask your mentee if he or she needs help in completing his or her
      MIP. MIPs should be completed by the third weekly mentor-mentee meeting.<br />
      <br />
      6.&nbsp;Is a mentee required to answer all questions in the MIP?</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; background: white"><span style="font-size: 11pt">It
      depends on their situation. For example, a mentee maybe working full&#8211;time and
      is taking 4 courses. Therefore, it is understandable if a mentee decides not to
      join any student organization and not complete the Student Involvement Plan section
      of the MIP. Other sections of the MIP, however, should be completed.</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; background: white"><span style=
      "font-size: 11pt">5.&nbsp;How will mentees know what is required from
      them?</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; background: white"><span style=
      "font-size: 11pt">Mentees will be provided with a copy of the MIP during their
      orientation and will be instructed to complete their MIP prior to meeting their
      mentors.<br />
      <br />
      6. What other requirements a mentee should fulfill during the semester?</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; background: white"><span style="font-size: 11pt">a.
      Attend one orientation;<br />
      b. Meet with mentor once a week ( Communications&nbsp;via Facebook, Twitter, email,
      texting and phone are all acceptable);<br />
      c. Attend three workshops (Academic&nbsp;or Life Skills workshops).</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; background: white"><span style="font-size: 11pt">d.
      Participate in one community service activity for at least&nbsp;two
      hours&nbsp;before the end of the semester.&nbsp; <a href=

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; background: white"><b><span style=
      "font-size: 11pt">Note</span></b><span style="font-size: 11pt">: An email or&nbsp;a
      letter from the supervisor who supervised the mentee's community service&nbsp;will
      suffice as proof of completion and should be submitted via email
      to:care@stockton.edu.</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; background: white"><span style="font-size: 11pt">7.
      What is a Life Skills Workshop?</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; background: white"><span style="font-size: 11pt">A
      Life Skills Workshop is a workshop designed to help students responsibly manage
      their personal affairs. Some examples are: Time Management, Managing Stress and How
      to Deal with Test Anxiety.</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; background: white"><span style="font-size: 11pt">8.
      What is an Academic Workshop?</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; background: white"><span style="font-size: 11pt">An
      Academic Workshop is a workshop designed to help students learn more about their
      selected courses, majors or academic pursuits. Some examples are: Communication
      Studies Workshop, Pre-Physical Theraphy Workshop, How to Prepare for Advising,
      Understanding the Financial Aid Process and Hospitality Management
      Workshop.</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; background: white"><span style="font-size: 11pt">9.
      How many workshops should a mentee attend each semester?</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; background: white"><span style="font-size: 11pt">A
      mentee should attend at least three workshops (Life Skills or Academic Workshops)
      and is allowed to attend workshops offered by other Stockton
      departments.</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; background: white"><span style=
      "font-size: 11pt">10. What will happen if a mentee has not completed the Program
      requirements at the end of the semester?</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; background: white"><span style=
      "font-size: 11pt">The CARE Program Coordinator will review all information
      pertaining to the mentee. The review may result in providing additional support and
      focus to the mentee or withdrawal of the mentee from the Program.</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; background: white"><span style=
      "font-size: 11pt">11. Can a Personal or Peer Mentor continue to be a mentor in the
      CARE Program each semester?<br />
      <br />
      Yes, as long as the Peer Mentor is in good academic standing (at least a cumulative
      GPA of 2.75) and perform his or her responsibilities as depicted on page 4 of the
      2013 Peer Mentor Manual.</span></p>

      <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; background: white"><span style=
      "font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt">As for Personal
      Mentors (faculty and staff), they may continue as mentors and may leave the Program
      as long as they advise the CARE Team prior to leaving the Program.<br />
      <br />
      12.&nbsp;Can a mentee withdraw or leave the Program?<br />
      <br />
      Yes, if the mentee joined the Program voluntarily. On the other hand, if a mentee
      was required by the Office of Financial Aid to join the Program because the student
      has to fulfill the College's Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy then this
      particular mentee cannot leave the Program unless approved by the Office of
      Financial Aid.<br />
      <br />
      13.&nbsp;What will happen if a mentee who is the second category mentioned above
      leaves the Program anyway?<br />
      <br />
      The student could lose his or her financial aid or status as a college student at
      Stockton.</span></p>
